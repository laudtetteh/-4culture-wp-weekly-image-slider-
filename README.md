# 4culture-wp-weekly-image-slider
The slider used on the Touring Arts homepage on the 4Culture website (https://www.4culture.org/touring-arts-roster)

1. The Featured Media at the top of this page can be set in the admin area to be a video, a single image or a slider.
2. When it is set to "slider", the tool cycles through a bunch of images pre-selected by the site admin in the WordPress dashboard, and changes the image every Monday at 12:00am.
3. If no 'next' image is found, it defaults to last image in the gallery field populated by the admin.
4. If there are no images at all, it defaults to the Featured Image for that page.
